"""Render a static HTML board page from an already-projected `board.Board`.

Pure: no clock, no randomness, no `gh`/`git` call of its own. `cli.py`'s
`board --html` (issue #276) and `board --serve` (issue #280) are its only two
callers -- both already hold every read this module needs from
`board.build_board`'s own inputs, `expectation_lines` (#240), and the
store's live claims, so building `BoardPage` and rendering it costs nothing
`board` was not already paying for. `render` stays the one state-to-page
function for both: `served=None` writes `--html`'s static page,
`ServedRuleForm` switches a card's affordance to a live form (#280) without a
second renderer.

The four sections follow the ruled picture (#234, #276), in fixed order:
"Wartet auf dich" (open `[[expectation]]` lines as cards, in the operator's
own words when `aco ask` gave them (issue #295): `question` as heading, the
inline-SVG `picture`, `example` -- else `text` alone, as before -- then the
copyable `aco rule` command per outcome when static, one `POST /rule` form
per card carrying the loopback token and the note, with the three outcomes
as its own submit buttons, when served), "Lanes" (active claims with the
item's own Now/Next/Blocked by/Done when, verbatim from the body), "Themen"
(containers with their open children, then standalone items), and
"Landungen" (`board.Board.landings`, issue #371: one row per item the trunk
walk names as landed under both storages, plus, under `github`, one more
row per item a merged pull request landed with no trailer of its own --
`board.landing_rows`'s own projection, read straight, never re-derived
here). The three knowlagentic-only conventions (`Plain:`/`For you:`,
`Stage:`, `(lane: slug)`) are gone: a lane shows the item's own title and
contract text, nothing else.
