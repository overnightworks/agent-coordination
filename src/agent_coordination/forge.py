"""The forge port: repository identity, typed failures, and the read/write surface.

`ForgeReader`/`ForgeWriter` are the provider-neutral contract every adapter
(today: GitHub) implements; `ForgeOperation` names every operation on that
contract and `Capability` answers, per operation, whether an adapter can
perform it at all. The GitHub adapter never itself refuses an operation.
`cli._load_board_config` is the one caller that branches on a capability
answer -- reading a work-item body's dependencies (#150) requires
`LIST_BOARD_DEPENDENCIES` at `READ_ONLY` or better, so a forge without it
cannot serve a board at all.
