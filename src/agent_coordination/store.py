"""`refs/aco/state` store: the fast-forward CAS transport for the claim state tree.

Sibling of `checkout`, not below it. `checkout`'s owner is this working tree --
current branch, isolation, cleanliness, agent identity -- and its git calls are
local (`rev-parse`, `ls-files`, `status`, `branch`). This module's owner is
repository-global state: a remote compare-and-swap ref, reached through
`ls-remote`, its own per-worktree anchor ref, plumbing, push, and retry.
Folding the two would let a worktree-local module own repository-global
state -- exactly the linked-worktree stamp collision `_lineage_stamp_path`
exists to avoid.

`cli` (issue #176, slice C2) is this module's production caller: `bootstrap`
and `commit_transition`. It never checks the state ref out: every read goes
through plumbing (`ls-remote`, a `fetch` anchored straight into its own
per-worktree ref, one recursive `ls-tree` and one `archive`, never a
`cat-file` per entry), and every write
builds a tree with `hash-object`/`mktree` -- reusing whatever a
transition's already-committed parent tree still carries unchanged (issue
#241) -- and a commit with `commit-tree`.

#   reproduced in the audit, and again by
#   `test_claim_ages_survives_a_gc_prune_of_the_just_fetched_history`);

    date, `rescopes` counts its rescope commits between them. `tip` is the
    caller's own already-fetched observation (the same seam `claim_ages`
    uses), never a fresh fetch this function performs itself.

    A `reset` (issue #298) deletes and rebuilds `STATE_REF` from an empty
    tree, so its bootstrap commit has no parent at all -- history "before
    the last reset" is excluded for free by this first-parent walk, never a
    date compared against here.

    Its `events` carry `metrics.LaneEvent`s with `size` and `landed_at` both
    `None`: this module reads no item content and no trunk landings at all
    (the "claim-state store is git transport only" contract; `checkout` and
    `store` are sibling layers, neither importing the other) -- joining an
    item's current size and its trunk-landing date onto these is

    `_parsed_transition` already keeps for a single malformed commit. A
    second `claim` for a `claim_id` this walk already opened, or a second
    `release`/`landing` for one it already closed, is the same kind of torn
    or duplicated history -- `protocol.apply`'s `consumed_ids` never lets a
    live `claim_id` be claimed twice or released twice, so a commit shaped
    that way cannot be a second genuine transition -- and is counted into
    `unparsed` the same way, its first (and only trustworthy) event left
    untouched rather than overwritten or duplicated (issue #357 gate B2). A
    `rescope` naming an already-released `claim_id` is the same kind of
    impossible history: `rescope` requires a live claim (`protocol.apply`,
    `specs/rescope.spec.md`), so a rescope commit after that claim's own

    `peek_state_for_reset`, that read through `_peek_tip` and so skip
    `fetch_state`'s own lineage guard, anchor, and stamp.

    The tip is `_ls_remote_state`'s own answer (issue #310 finding 48): the
    fetch that follows (`_fetch_ref_objects`) only brings the objects into
    this worktree's local store so `_parse_state_tree` can read them -- it
    writes no destination ref, and `--no-write-fetch-head` keeps it from
    even landing the tip in `FETCH_HEAD`, so a concurrent `git fetch`
    anywhere else in this same worktree can race it however it likes: this
    read never looks at `FETCH_HEAD`, and `fetch_state`'s own fetch keeps
    out of it the same way, reading its anchor instead. `--no-tags` keeps a
    reachable tag on `STATE_REF`'s own history from auto-following into the
    shared local `refs/tags/*` namespace during this read.

    `reset` reads this way, through `peek_state_for_reset`, to recover from
    exactly what `_check_lineage` refuses -- a rewritten or deleted ref this
    worktree's own stamp disagrees with -- so it reads and acts on whatever
    tip is on `remote` right now, never against this worktree's history.
    `land`'s preflight uses it to observe a live claim before its first
    write: a pull request this preflight goes on to refuse must never have
    anchored a ref or stamped a lineage the merge itself never happens. Both
    callers share the same requirement -- a dry run, a live-claim refusal, a
    failed export, or a refused merge must change nothing durable -- so this
    performs no per-worktree write at all: no anchor write, no
    `_write_lineage_stamp`, no local tag, no `FETCH_HEAD`. `fetch_state`
    stays the write-capable read every live transition (`claim`, `release`,

    skipped the temporary file's removal entirely, and both cleanups
    suppressed their own `OSError`/nonzero-exit without naming what was left

    is named in the raised error, together with the write/publish failure
