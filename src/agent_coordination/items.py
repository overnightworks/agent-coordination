"""Pure codec for one state-ref item file's `[record]` table (issue #248).

An item file (`items/<id>.md` in the tree of `refs/aco/state`) is a
work-item body in the same `agent-claim`-block grammar `body.py` already
reads and writes, extended with a nested `[record]` table that exists only
under `storage = "state-ref"`: the identity and relations a GitHub issue
would otherwise carry through its native type, sub-issue, and blocked-by
relations. `body.py`'s schema (`parse_body`/`_block_record_defects`)
already validates that table's shape before this module ever sees it; this
module turns the validated raw values into `ItemRecord`, and turns an item
file's own name into its id and number.

This module sits below `board.py` and `body.py` in the Layers contract
(`items` may import `body`, never `board`, and never the reverse of either).
`state_board.py`, the adapter that assembles `board.Issue`/`IssueDependency`/
`ChildItem`/`ParentIssue` from several `ItemRecord`s at once, sits above all
three.
