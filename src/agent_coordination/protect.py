"""Owns `aco protect`'s own judgement (issue #394, caller: architecture-audit
distributor #389 finding 2): `judge` reads one already-parsed hook payload
and returns a typed `Verdict` -- allow or deny, with the deny reason -- from
the payload envelope checks (PROT-03..) through the shared Checkout/
Default-Branch/Claim-Scope/Bash-pattern chain every mutating tool call runs.
`cli` keeps only reading stdin, calling `judge`, and printing the verdict's
own JSON envelope under one `except Exception` frame (PROT-17); this module
never touches stdin or stdout itself. `specs/protect.spec.md` owns every
denial reason, the order they are judged in, and the JSON shape and exit
codes `Verdict.to_json`/`Verdict.exit_code` produce -- this file cites those
IDs rather than restating them.

`judge` takes `canonical_remote_for` as an explicit dependency rather than
resolving it itself: reading `.agent-claim/board.toml`'s own storage pin
(PIN-01) is `cli`'s own board-configuration concern, shared by every store
command, not something this lower layer re-implements or reaches upward
for.
