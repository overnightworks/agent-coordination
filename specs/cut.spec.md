# `aco cut`

`aco cut <container> --title T`: create a container's next slice as a fresh
child, remove that slice's own `[[slice]]` row from the container's block,
and recover instead of duplicating when a prior run already got partway.
This file owns the command's own target precondition, row selection,
`--scope` inheritance (issue #337), the twin search `cut` and `item new`
share before either creates an issue (issue #444), the fresh child's own body, the printed
`CUT`/`ADOPTED` line and `--json` shape, and the two ways a partial failure
recovers. `specs/body-block.spec.md` owns the `[[slice]]` schema (BODY-43..
BODY-49) and a malformed body's own defect sentences (BODY-01..BODY-52);
`specs/storage-pin.spec.md` owns the id-argument grammar `<container>`
accepts (PIN-08), the fresh child's own state-ref CAS write, the same path
`item new` shares (PIN-21), and `record.parent`'s own existence check
(PIN-16); `specs/ref-store-cas.spec.md` owns the stale-write sentence a
raced state-ref write meets (CAS-20). This file cites those IDs rather than
restating them. `<n>` is the container's own number, `<child>` the fresh or
adopted child's, `<idx>` a `[[slice]]` row's `index`. A printed `#<n>` or
`#<child>` below, outside `item show`'s own header (ITEM-07), is the
`storage = "github"` form of `specs/landing-grammar.spec.md`'s `<label>`;
under `storage = "state-ref"` it prints the item id (PIN-30). A refusal reaching the
shared collection point prints `ERROR: <sentence>` on stderr, exit `2`, and
with `--json` also `specs/output.spec.md`'s envelope, `reason`
`precondition_failed` -- except CUT-17/CUT-18/CUT-32's own partial write, whose
`reason` is `partial_write` instead (CUT-28).

## The target

- [ ] [CUT-01] `aco cut <n> --title T` against an `<n>` that names no open issue on the board refuses `#<n> is not an open container`, exit `2`, before any write.
- [ ] [CUT-33] An empty or whitespace-only `--title` refuses `--title must be a non-empty string`, exit `2`, before anything is read or written; `--json` prints OUT-06's envelope (issue #447).
- [ ] [CUT-02] The same against an open issue that is not a container refuses `#<n> is not a container`, exit `2`.
- [ ] [CUT-03] The same against a container that is itself a child of another item refuses `#<n> is itself a child of <ref>; nested containers are not supported`, exit `2`.
- [ ] [CUT-34] `aco next` never proposes a cut CUT-03 refuses: it names a nested container's repair under `SKIPPED` instead (`specs/next.spec.md` NEXT-25, E-NEXT-09).

## The forge precondition

- [ ] [CUT-04] `aco cut` refuses `this forge cannot <operation>; cut the slice by hand` for an unsupported `create_child`, `link_child`, or `update_item_body`, exit `2`.

## The body precondition

- [ ] [CUT-05] `<n>` with a malformed body (BODY-50) refuses `#<n> body malformed: <field>: <message>; cut needs a valid aco block`, exit `2`; an incomplete body (BODY-51) is accepted.

## Row selection

- [ ] [CUT-06] With no `--row`, `aco cut <n> --title T` links the first `[[slice]]` entry; `--row N` links entry `N` by its own `index` instead, whichever position it holds.
- [ ] [CUT-07] A linked row whose own `title` differs from `--title` refuses `#<n>'s slice <idx> is titled '<row-title>'; --title must match it exactly`, exit `2`, before any write.
- [ ] [CUT-08] `--row N` against a block with no `slice` key at all refuses `#<n> has no slice table; --row needs one to select a row from`, exit `2`.
- [ ] [CUT-09] `--row N` naming no entry refuses `#<n> has no row N; cuttable rows: <comma-joined indices, or none>`, exit `2` (see E-CUT-03).
- [ ] [CUT-10] A block with no `slice` key, or `slice = []`, links no row: the child gets none, the container's body stays unwritten, the printed line carries no ` row <idx>` suffix (see E-CUT-04).

## Creating the child

- [ ] [CUT-11] A successful cut prints `CUT #<n>[ row <idx>] -> #<child>`, the `row <idx>` clause present only when a row was linked, exit `0` (see E-CUT-02, E-CUT-04).
- [ ] [CUT-12] `aco cut ... --json` prints `specs/output.spec.md`'s envelope, `reason` `cut` or `adopted` (CUT-13), then `container`, `row`, `child` (see E-CUT-02).
- [ ] [CUT-25] The fresh child's body is a `Parent: <label>` line naming `<n>`, a blank line, the same unfilled `task` skeleton `item new` writes (ITEM-01), plus `scope` from CUT-20/CUT-23 (see E-CUT-02, E-CUT-06).

## Adopting instead of duplicating

- [ ] [CUT-13] An open issue titled exactly `--title` -- linked already, or a recovery orphan (CUT-16) -- is adopted: `ADOPTED` replaces `CUT`, `reason: "adopted"` in `--json` (see E-CUT-05).
- [ ] [CUT-14] A closed child already titled `--title`, with no open match, refuses `#<n> already has a closed child #<child> titled '<title>'; reopen it or remove the row by hand`, exit `2`.
- [ ] [CUT-15] Two or more open matches refuses `#<n>'s row '<title>' matches more than one open issue (#a, #b); adopt the right one by hand and remove the row`, exit `2`, naming every match.
- [ ] [CUT-16] An open issue sharing `--title` is adopted only in CUT-13's recovery shape -- never the container itself, idea-labelled, non-`task`, or naming a different `Parent:` (see E-CUT-05).

## The twin search (issue #444)

- [ ] [CUT-29] Before a fresh child exists, `aco cut` compares `--title` with the titles of every open issue and every issue closed within the last 30 days, the container itself excepted.
- [ ] [CUT-30] Titles sharing at least 60 % of their combined distinct casefolded words (3 of 5 twin, 2 of 4 not) refuse `possible twin #<n>; pass --not-a-twin`, exit `2`, before any write (see E-CUT-05, E-CUT-09).
- [ ] [CUT-31] An identical title always twins, even without a word; the refusal names the closest title, the lower number on a tie; `--not-a-twin` skips the search and creates; an adoption (CUT-13) never searches.

## Partial failure and recovery

- [ ] [CUT-17] GitHub's own failed sub-issue relation write refuses `created #<child> but failed to record #<child> as a sub-issue of #<n>: <cause>; re-run the same cut -- it adopts the child`, exit `2`.
- [ ] [CUT-18] A failed row-removal write, either storage, refuses `created #<child> but failed to remove row <idx> from #<n>'s aco block: <cause>; re-run the same cut -- it adopts the child`, exit `2`.
- [ ] [CUT-19] An identical re-run after CUT-17, CUT-18, or -- once its type is set -- CUT-32 prints `ADOPTED` (CUT-13) instead of a second child, then finishes the row removal when a row was linked (see E-CUT-06).
- [ ] [CUT-32] A child created without its `Task` type refuses `created #<child> but GitHub did not set its type Task; set that type on the forge by hand, then re-run the same cut -- it adopts the child`, exit `2`.
- [ ] [CUT-28] CUT-17/CUT-18/CUT-32's partial write reports `reason: "partial_write"`, `written` (`<child>`) and `failed` (the step) as siblings, exit `2` (see E-CUT-08).

## `--scope` (issue #337)

- [ ] [CUT-20] `--scope P` with a linked row that carries none becomes the fresh child's own top-level `scope`; the row is removed along with the rest, never rewritten to carry it.
- [ ] [CUT-21] `--scope P` against a linked row that already names one refuses `slice <idx> already names a scope; edit the container instead`, exit `2` -- the row is the one place to change it.
- [ ] [CUT-22] With no `--scope`, a linked row that already names one leaves the child inheriting that scope verbatim; the row itself is unchanged before its removal.
- [ ] [CUT-23] `--scope P` with no linked row at all (CUT-10) becomes the fresh child's own top-level `scope` directly, no row ever touched.
- [ ] [CUT-24] With no linked row and no `--scope`, the fresh child carries no top-level `scope` key at all.

## `storage = "state-ref"`, the same command over one CAS write

- [ ] [CUT-26] Removing a `[[slice]]` row under `storage = "state-ref"` preserves every byte outside the block's interior; the interior re-renders canonically (BODY-07), not byte-for-byte (see E-CUT-07).
- [ ] [CUT-27] Under `storage = "state-ref"`, the fresh child's body carries CUT-25's `Parent:` prose and a `[record]` table whose `parent` names the container's item id (PIN-16) (see E-CUT-07).

## Never

- `aco cut` never creates a second child for a row already linked to an open issue: CUT-13's adoption always runs before a fresh child is ever considered.
- `aco cut` never reaches CUT-17's own relation-write failure under `storage = "state-ref"`: the child's own mint is one CAS write that can fail before any child exists -- a plain re-run then starts over as a fresh cut, nothing to adopt -- and CUT-18's row-removal step can fail once the child exists.
- `aco cut` never touches the container's own `now`, `next`, or `done_when` fields, or any `[[slice]]` row but the one linked: a row removal's own rewrite carries every other field forward unchanged (CUT-26).
- `aco cut` never re-parents an issue by title alone: an orphan is adopted only through CUT-16's own recovery-shape check, never a bare string match.
- `aco cut`'s own `--json` object never uses the storage-aware `<label>` form (`specs/landing-grammar.spec.md`): `container`, `child`, and `written` are always the bare number, under either storage pin.
- CUT-25's own body shape differs between the storage pins only in its `Parent:` line's `<label>`; only `storage = "state-ref"` additionally sets `[record].parent` (CUT-27) -- GitHub carries no such field, so its own retry (CUT-19) reads the `Parent:` prose line instead, while a state-ref retry reads `record.parent` alone.
- Under `storage = "state-ref"`, a CUT-19 retry caused by a competing write names CAS-20's own "written since it was read" sentence as CUT-18's own `<cause>`.

## Examples

`Setup: bare-remote` is a fresh work repository whose `origin` is a local
bare repository with `main` at one commit, a git identity, `origin/HEAD`,
and `ACO_AGENT` set to `Ada`. A session under `storage = "github"` (the
default, no `storage` key tracked) also names a fixed, deterministic fake
`gh` as a setup precondition; a session under `storage = "state-ref"` names
no `gh` at all -- `PATH` carries none.

### E-CUT-01 -- refused before any write: not open, not a container, already parented

Setup: bare-remote, `storage = "github"`, fake `gh`

```console
$ aco cut 90 --title "Slice A"
2> ERROR: #90 is not an open container
exit 2
$ aco cut 91 --title "Slice A"
2> ERROR: #91 is not a container
exit 2
$ aco cut 92 --title "Slice A"
2> ERROR: #92 is itself a child of example/agent-coordination#80; nested containers are not supported
exit 2
```

### E-CUT-02 -- a tied cut, text and `--json`, then row selection by number

Setup: bare-remote, `storage = "github"`, fake `gh`, container `#90` with two
`[[slice]]` rows, `index = 1` titled `Slice A`, `index = 2` titled `Slice B`

```console
$ aco cut 90 --title "Slice A"
CUT #90 row 1 -> #<child-a>
exit 0
$ aco cut 90 --title "Slice B" --row 2 --json
{"ok": true, "reason": "cut", "container": 90, "row": 2, "child": <child-b>}
exit 0
```

### E-CUT-03 -- row refusals

Setup: bare-remote, `storage = "github"`, fake `gh`, container `#90`, one
`[[slice]]` row `index = 1` titled `Slice A`

```console
$ aco cut 90 --title "Slice A" --row 9
2> ERROR: #90 has no row 9; cuttable rows: 1
exit 2
$ aco cut 90 --title "Wrong title"
2> ERROR: #90's slice 1 is titled 'Slice A'; --title must match it exactly
exit 2
```

### E-CUT-04 -- an untied container, no slice table

Setup: bare-remote, `storage = "github"`, fake `gh`, container `#90` with no
`slice` key at all

```console
$ aco cut 90 --title "Loose work" --row 1
2> ERROR: #90 has no slice table; --row needs one to select a row from
exit 2
$ aco cut 90 --title "Loose work"
CUT #90 -> #<child>
exit 0
```

### E-CUT-05 -- adoption after a partial failure, and a look-alike that is not adopted

Setup: bare-remote, `storage = "github"`, fake `gh`, container `#90` with one
`[[slice]]` row `index = 1` titled `Slice A`; a first `aco cut 90 --title
"Slice A"` already left an open, unlinked orphan `#<child>` (its relation
write failed)

```console
$ aco cut 90 --title "Slice A"
ADOPTED #90 row 1 -> #<child>
exit 0
```

Setup: bare-remote, `storage = "github"`, fake `gh`, container `#90` with one
`[[slice]]` row `index = 1` titled `Slice A`, and an unrelated open issue
`#<lookalike>` also titled `Slice A` but labelled `idea`

```console
$ aco cut 90 --title "Slice A"
2> ERROR: possible twin #<lookalike>; pass --not-a-twin
exit 2
$ aco cut 90 --title "Slice A" --not-a-twin
CUT #90 row 1 -> #<child>
exit 0
```

### E-CUT-06 -- `--scope`, filled, inherited, and refused

Setup: bare-remote, `storage = "github"`, fake `gh`, container `#90` with one
empty `[[slice]]` row `index = 1` titled `Slice A`

```console
$ aco cut 90 --title "Slice A" --scope src/a.py
CUT #90 row 1 -> #<child>
exit 0
```

A second container `#91`'s row already names `scope = ["src/b.py"]`:

```console
$ aco cut 91 --title "Slice B" --scope src/other.py
2> ERROR: slice 1 already names a scope; edit the container instead
exit 2
$ aco cut 91 --title "Slice B"
CUT #91 row 1 -> #<child>
exit 0
```

### E-CUT-07 -- `storage = "state-ref"`, byte-exact removal and `record.parent`

Setup: bare-remote, `storage = "state-ref"` tracked, bootstrapped, container
`aco-000001` (`#<n>`) with two `[[slice]]` rows, `index = 1` titled `Slice
C`, `index = 2` titled `Slice D`

````console
$ aco cut <n> --title "Slice C"
CUT aco-000001 row 1 -> <child-id>
exit 0
$ aco item show <child-id>
<child-id> · #<child> · open · parent aco-000001 · origin none

created_at = "<created_at>"
updated_at = "<updated_at>"
```
exit 0
````

### E-CUT-08 -- `--json` on a partial write

Setup: bare-remote, `storage = "github"`, fake `gh`, container `#90` with one
`[[slice]]` row `index = 1` titled `Slice A`, the freshly created child's own
sub-issue relation write fails

```console
$ aco cut 90 --title "Slice A" --json
{"ok": false, "reason": "partial_write", "written": <child>, "failed": "record #<child> as a sub-issue of #90", "message": "created #<child> but failed to record #<child> as a sub-issue of #90: <cause>; re-run the same cut -- it adopts the child"}
2> ERROR: created #<child> but failed to record #<child> as a sub-issue of #90: <cause>; re-run the same cut -- it adopts the child
exit 2
```

### E-CUT-09 -- a twin closed last week, then `--json`

Setup: bare-remote, `storage = "github"`, fake `gh`, container `#90` with no
`slice` key at all; `#85`, titled `Import the ledger`, closed six days ago

```console
$ aco cut 90 --title "Import ledger"
2> ERROR: possible twin #85; pass --not-a-twin
exit 2
$ aco cut 90 --title "Import ledger" --json
{"ok": false, "reason": "precondition_failed", "message": "possible twin #85; pass --not-a-twin"}
2> ERROR: possible twin #85; pass --not-a-twin
exit 2
```
