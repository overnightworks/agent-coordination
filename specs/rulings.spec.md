# `aco rulings`

`aco rulings` lists every open board item that carries at least one
`[[expectation]]` line, fully ruled ones too, read-only. This file owns its
row and per-line text, its ordering, its `--json` shape, and its empty-board
sentence. It cites the forge-resolution precondition `specs/board.spec.md`
owns (BOARD-01/BOARD-02/BOARD-42) rather than restating it, and the
`RULE-01`/`ASK-01` write paths that fill the lines this command only reads;
`specs/output.spec.md` owns the `--json` envelope itself (OUT-nn: key
order, `ok`, `message`) that wraps RUL-05's own `rulings` array. `<n>` is an
item number, `<label>` an item as `specs/landing-grammar.spec.md` prints
it, `<k>` an expectation line's 1-based index.

## Behavior table

| state \ trigger | text | `--json` |
|---|---|---|
| unsupported forge host / untracked pin | BOARD-01/02 (cited) | BOARD-01/02 (cited) |
| `--repo` under `storage = "state-ref"` | BOARD-42 (cited) | BOARD-42 (cited), RUL-09 |
| an item with an open expectation line | RUL-01, RUL-02 | RUL-05, RUL-10 |
| several such items | RUL-03 | RUL-05, RUL-10 |
| an item whose every line is already ruled | RUL-01, RUL-04 | RUL-05, RUL-10 |
| a ruled line | RUL-02 | RUL-05, RUL-10 |
| a line's `question`/`example`/`picture` | — | RUL-06 |
| no item on the whole board carries an expectation line | RUL-07 | RUL-08 |
| a title or line holds a display control | RUL-11 | RUL-10, RUL-11 |

## Rows and lines

- [ ] [RUL-01] Each listed item prints one header, `<label> <open>/<total>: <title>`, then one line per expectation entry -- ruled ones too -- in block order (see E-RUL-01, E-RUL-05).
- [ ] [RUL-02] A still-open line prints `  <k> open: <summary>`; a ruled one prints `  <k> ruled <outcome> <date>: <summary>`, `<summary>` capped at 100 characters total, its last char `…` when cut (see E-RUL-01).
- [ ] [RUL-11] Text shows `<title>` and `<summary>` with each display control escaped (NEXT-37), `<summary>` after its cap; `--json` carries both as stored.
- [ ] [RUL-03] Rows rank by priority category, score, fewer open lines, ascending `<n>` (never `board --json`'s raw order); open-line items precede fully ruled ones, each group in that order (see E-RUL-02).
- [ ] [RUL-04] An item whose every expectation line is already ruled is listed, in both text and `--json`, in the fully-ruled group RUL-03 orders last (see E-RUL-02, E-RUL-05).

## `--json`

- [ ] [RUL-05] `rulings --json` wraps OUT-nn (`reason: "listed"`) around a `rulings` array (see E-RUL-03, E-RUL-05).
- [ ] [RUL-10] Each `rulings` row is `{"number", "title", "open", "total", "lines"}`; each line `{"index", "text", "ruling", "ruled_on"}`, both `null` when open, untruncated text (see E-RUL-03, E-RUL-05).
- [ ] [RUL-06] A line's `question`/`example`/`picture` (`aco ask`, ASK-03) each add their own key, present only when that field was given.
- [ ] [RUL-09] `--json` on a dispatched refusal (BOARD-02, BOARD-42) prints OUT-nn's envelope with the sentence as `message` and `reason` from the table below, exit `2` (see E-RUL-06).

`reason`, by which refusal fired:

| refusal | `reason` |
|---|---|
| PIN-04 (`--repo` under `storage = state-ref`) | `invalid_usage` |
| BOARD-02 (no forge adapter for host), PIN-05 (no resolvable default branch) | `unavailable` |

## Empty board

- [ ] [RUL-07] With no item on the whole board carrying an expectation line, text output is exactly `No expectation lines.`, exit `0` (see E-RUL-04).
- [ ] [RUL-08] The same board's `--json` prints `{"ok": true, "reason": "listed", "rulings": []}`, exit `0` (see E-RUL-04).

## Never

- `aco rulings` never writes: it reads the same open-board projection `board`/`next` already build, and nothing else.
- `aco rulings` never re-scans an item's stale prose for its progress counts: a `## Erwartungen` heading left beside the block plays no part -- only the block's own `[[expectation]]` entries are read.

## Examples

`Setup: bare-remote` is a fresh work repository whose `origin` is a local
bare repository with `main` at one commit, a git identity, `origin/HEAD`, a
tracked `.agent-claim/board.toml`, and `ACO_AGENT` set to `Ada`. A session
reading GitHub issues also names a fixed, deterministic fake `gh` as a
setup precondition (the shape `specs/landing-grammar.spec.md` already
uses).

### E-RUL-01 — one item, an open line and a ruled line

Setup: bare-remote, fake `gh`, issue `#10` open, one open and one ruled `[[expectation]]` line

```console
$ aco rulings
#10 1/2: Open expectation
  1 open: Open decision 0.
  2 ruled yes 2026-09-19: Settled decision 0.
exit 0
```

### E-RUL-02 — ranked rows, a fully-ruled item ordered last

Setup: bare-remote, fake `gh`, issue `#50` in-flight with two open lines, issue `#60` a lower-priority item with one open line, issue `#70` fully ruled

```console
$ aco rulings
#50 2/3: In-flight security work
  1 open: Name it.
  2 open: Name it too.
  3 ruled yes 2026-09-19: Settled.
#60 1/1: Lower-priority product work
  1 open: Ship it?
#70 0/1: Fully ruled security work
  1 ruled yes 2026-09-19: Settled.
exit 0
```

### E-RUL-03 — `--json`

Setup: bare-remote, fake `gh`, issue `#10` as in E-RUL-01

```console
$ aco rulings --json
{"ok": true, "reason": "listed", "rulings": [{"number": 10, "title": "Open expectation", "open": 1, "total": 2, "lines": [{"index": 1, "text": "Open decision 0.", "ruling": null, "ruled_on": null}, {"index": 2, "text": "Settled decision 0.", "ruling": "yes", "ruled_on": "2026-09-19"}]}]}
exit 0
```

### E-RUL-04 — no board item carries an expectation line

Setup: bare-remote, fake `gh`, no open issue's body carries an `[[expectation]]` line

```console
$ aco rulings
No expectation lines.
exit 0
$ aco rulings --json
{"ok": true, "reason": "listed", "rulings": []}
exit 0
```

### E-RUL-05 — a fully-ruled item, text and `--json`

Setup: bare-remote, fake `gh`, issue `#11` open with two ruled `[[expectation]]` lines, no open line anywhere

```console
$ aco rulings
#11 0/2: Fully ruled
  1 ruled yes 2026-09-19: Settled decision 0.
  2 ruled yes 2026-09-19: Settled decision 1.
exit 0
$ aco rulings --json
{"ok": true, "reason": "listed", "rulings": [{"number": 11, "title": "Fully ruled", "open": 0, "total": 2, "lines": [{"index": 1, "text": "Settled decision 0.", "ruling": "yes", "ruled_on": "2026-09-19"}, {"index": 2, "text": "Settled decision 1.", "ruling": "yes", "ruled_on": "2026-09-19"}]}]}
exit 0
```

### E-RUL-06 — `--json` refusal envelope, `--repo` under `storage = state-ref`

Setup: bare-remote, `storage = "state-ref"` tracked

```console
$ aco --repo acme/items rulings --json
2> ERROR: --repo is meaningless under storage = state-ref
{"ok": false, "reason": "invalid_usage", "message": "--repo is meaningless under storage = state-ref"}
exit 2
```
