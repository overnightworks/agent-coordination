# Storage pin

`storage = "github" | "state-ref"` in `.agent-claim/board.toml` (default
`github`): which adapter owns this repository's board and item data. This
file owns the pin's own values and precondition, which commands the pin
gates by name, the two item id forms it chooses between, and the
state-ref item file's own defects one layer above the `agent-claim` block
grammar. `specs/body-block.spec.md` owns the block's own schema, including
`[record]`'s field-by-field validity (BODY-15..BODY-20) once the pin has
already gated it open; this file never restates those sentences. `<path>`
is `.agent-claim/board.toml`, the pin's own file. Every refusal below
reaches `ERROR: <sentence>` on stderr, exit `2`, unless noted otherwise.

## Behavior table

| pin state \ trigger | any store command | `item new` | `item edit` / `item close` | `release --merged` | an id argument |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `.agent-claim/board.toml` untracked, absent, or ignored | PIN-01 | PIN-01 | PIN-01 | PIN-01 | — |
| `storage` unset (default `github`) | PIN-02 | ITEM-26..ITEM-35 | PIN-10, PIN-11 | — | PIN-08 |
| `storage` names an unrecognized value | PIN-03 | PIN-03 | PIN-03 | PIN-03 | — |
| `storage = "state-ref"` | PIN-04\*, PIN-05\*, PIN-30 | PIN-18..21 | PIN-22..28 | —\*\* | PIN-08 |
| a state-ref item file itself is malformed | PIN-13..17, PIN-29 | ITEM-37 | ITEM-39, PIN-29 | LAND-65 | — |
| a fresh item id, minted | PIN-06, PIN-07 | PIN-06, PIN-07 | — | — | — |

\* PIN-04/PIN-05 gate only a command that resolves this repository's item
forge, a narrower set than "any store command" -- see `## Never` for the
exact commands that never do.

\*\* `release --merged` under `storage = "state-ref"` is no longer a pin
precondition (PIN-12, retired): `<sha|empty>` verifies and closes the named
issue itself, and only an issue-less lane still refuses -- that grammar,
including the surviving refusal, is `specs/landing-grammar.spec.md`'s own
(LAND-47, LAND-52, LAND-56, LAND-59), not restated here.

## The pin and its precondition

- [ ] [PIN-01] Any store command with an untracked, absent, or ignored `<path>` refuses `<path> is not tracked in this checkout, so its storage pin cannot be trusted: git add -f <path>` (E-PIN-01).
- [ ] [PIN-02] A tracked `.agent-claim/board.toml` naming no `storage` key pins `storage = "github"`, the default every existing repository already reads.
- [ ] [PIN-03] A tracked `.agent-claim/board.toml` naming a `storage` value outside `github`/`state-ref` refuses `board configuration <path> storage must be 'github' or 'state-ref'` (see E-PIN-02).

## `storage = "state-ref"` is forge-free

- [ ] [PIN-04] Under `storage = "state-ref"`, a command resolving the item forge refuses `--repo` with `--repo is meaningless under storage = state-ref`.
- [ ] [PIN-05] Under `storage = "state-ref"`, that same command with no `origin/HEAD` set refuses `cannot resolve the default branch; run aco from a checkout with origin/HEAD set`.

## Item identity: `aco-xxxxxx` versus `#n`

- [ ] [PIN-06] `aco item new --title TITLE` under `storage = "state-ref"` prints exactly one line, the minted id `aco-` plus six lowercase hex characters, exit `0` (see E-PIN-03).
- [ ] [PIN-07] `aco item new --title TITLE --json` prints `specs/output.spec.md`'s envelope: `{"ok": true, "reason": "created", "item": "aco-xxxxxx", "number": n}`.
- [ ] [PIN-30] Under `storage = "state-ref"` a printed sentence or string `--json` field names an item `aco-xxxxxx`, never `#<n>`; only the claim ledger's own sentences (PIN-26) keep `#<n>`.
- [ ] [PIN-08] An id argument matching none of `aco-xxxxxx`, `#n`, or the bare number `n` refuses `'<value>' is not an item reference; use aco-xxxxxx, #n, or the bare number n` (see E-PIN-04).

## Commands refused by the wrong pin

- PIN-09 (retired 26.09.2026, issue #444): `aco item new` under `storage = "github"` no longer refuses; it creates the GitHub issue itself (`specs/item.spec.md` ITEM-26..ITEM-35).
- [ ] [PIN-10] `aco item edit ITEM` under `storage = "github"` refuses `forge issues are edited on the forge; aco never governs them`.
- [ ] [PIN-11] `aco item close ITEM` under `storage = "github"` refuses `the forge closes its issues; aco never governs them`.
- PIN-12 (retired 19.09.2026, issue #359): the outright `release --merged` refusal it named under `storage = "state-ref"` no longer exists; `--merged <sha|empty>` verifies and closes the named issue itself (`specs/landing-grammar.spec.md` LAND-47/LAND-52/LAND-59), and only an issue-less lane still refuses (LAND-56).

## The state-ref item file, one layer above the block

- [ ] [PIN-13] An `items/<id>.md` entry whose filename is not `aco-` plus six lowercase hex characters plus `.md` makes a state-ref read refuse `items/<name> is not a valid item file name`.
- [ ] [PIN-14] A read of an `items/<id>.md` entry whose bytes are not valid UTF-8 refuses `item <id> is not valid UTF-8`, then ITEM-38's repair clause.
- [ ] [PIN-15] A read of an `items/<id>.md` entry with no valid `agent-claim` block and `[record]` refuses `item <id> has a malformed agent-claim block`, then ITEM-38's repair clause (see E-PIN-07).
- [ ] [PIN-16] An item whose own `record.parent` names an id no `items/` entry carries refuses `item <parent-id> is referenced as a parent but does not exist`.
- [ ] [PIN-17] An item whose own `record.blocked_by` names an id no `items/` entry carries refuses `item <blocker-id> is listed as a blocker but does not exist`.
- [ ] [PIN-29] While PIN-14/PIN-15 refuse an item, `board`, `next`, `rulings`, `cut`, `item close`, a fresh issue-mode `claim`/`start`, and child listings refuse with the lowest such id before any write (E-PIN-07).

## Writing a fresh state-ref item

- [ ] [PIN-18] `aco item new --title TITLE --parent PARENT` against a `PARENT` no `items/` entry carries refuses `<parent-id> does not exist`, before any write.
- [ ] [PIN-19] Three failed random-hex mint attempts against an already-full six-character neighbourhood refuse `could not mint a fresh item id in 3 attempts; retry`, before any write.
- [ ] [PIN-20] `aco item new --title TITLE --origin gitlab#514` stores that reference in `record.origin`, so `aco item show <item-id>` ends its header `origin gitlab#514`, never `origin none`.
- [ ] [PIN-21] `aco item new` under `storage = "state-ref"` writes through the same one CAS write path `aco cut`'s own child creation uses (`specs/ref-store-cas.spec.md`, CAS-19..CAS-21).

## Editing and closing a state-ref item

- [ ] [PIN-22] `aco item edit ITEM < body.md` under `storage = "state-ref"` replaces the item's stored body and prints `EDITED aco-xxxxxx`, exit `0` (see E-PIN-08).
- [ ] [PIN-23] `aco item edit ITEM` against an `ITEM` no `items/` entry carries refuses `<item-id> does not exist in <repository>` (`<repository>`: PIN-28).
- [ ] [PIN-24] `aco item edit ITEM` piping a body with no valid `agent-claim` block refuses with that body's own first defect sentence (`specs/body-block.spec.md`, BODY-01..BODY-50).
- [ ] [PIN-25] `aco item close ITEM` under `storage = "state-ref"` prints `CLOSED aco-xxxxxx` then a `freed: ` line naming every item `ITEM`'s own close just freed, or `freed: none`, exit `0` (see E-PIN-09).
- [ ] [PIN-26] `aco item close ITEM` against an item still carrying a live claim refuses `#<n> has a live claim (<agent> (<role>)); release the claim first`, before any write.
- [ ] [PIN-27] A second `aco item close ITEM` on an already-closed item refuses `<item-id> is already closed (closed on <closed_at>)`.
- [ ] [PIN-28] `aco item close ITEM` for an `ITEM` no `items/` entry carries refuses `<item-id> does not exist in <repository>`: `owner/repo` on a forge host, a forge-less remote's own path (E-PIN-10).

## Never

- `aco item edit`/`close` never reach a GitHub API call: each is refused by name under `storage = "github"` before the item forge is ever resolved; `item new` there opens the issue itself (`specs/item.spec.md`, ITEM-26).
- Under `storage = "state-ref"`, `aco status`, `aco protect`, `aco bootstrap`, `aco rescope`, `aco release`, and a lane or already-observed `aco claim` never resolve the item forge, so PIN-04/PIN-05 never gate them.
- `--repo` never selects a repository under `storage = "state-ref"`: there is no host-based target to override.
- `aco item edit`/`close` never overwrite a concurrent writer's change: a stale expected oid refuses by name instead (`specs/ref-store-cas.spec.md`, CAS-20), and the item's stored bytes stay exactly what the last landed write left.
- A `board --serve` ruling click never lands beside an item that turned malformed after PIN-29's check: its write commits only onto the `items/` it checked, else refuses `items/ was written since this write checked it; re-read and retry`.
- A replayed `aco claim` (CLM-15) and an `aco start` resuming its live claim (START-06) never read the board — a wide scope naming no `--whole` reads its own item's `whole` alone — so PIN-29 never refuses them.
- `aco item close` never deletes an item file or any of its other bytes: only `state`, `closed_at`, and `updated_at` move.

## Examples

`Setup: bare-remote` is a fresh work repository whose `origin` is a local bare
repository with `main` at one commit, a git identity, `origin/HEAD`, and
`ACO_AGENT` set to `Ada`; `<remote>`, `<tmp>`, and `<home>` are the runner's
own paths, `<item-id>` the id a session itself minted.

### E-PIN-01 — an untracked pin refuses before anything else

Setup: bare-remote, `.agent-claim/board.toml` present on disk but never `git add`ed

```console
$ aco status
2> ERROR: .agent-claim/board.toml is not tracked in this checkout, so its storage pin cannot be trusted: git add -f .agent-claim/board.toml
exit 2
```

### E-PIN-02 — an unrecognized storage value

Setup: bare-remote, `.agent-claim/board.toml` tracked with `storage = "gitlab"`

```console
$ aco status
2> ERROR: board configuration .agent-claim/board.toml storage must be 'github' or 'state-ref'
exit 2
```

### E-PIN-03 — a fresh state-ref item, minted and shown

Setup: bare-remote, bootstrapped, `storage = "state-ref"` tracked

````console
$ aco item new --title "Reset export"
<item-id>
exit 0
$ aco item show <item-id>
<item-id> · #n · open · parent none · origin none
```agent-claim
version = 1
now = ""
next = ""
done_when = ""

[record]
title = "Reset export"
state = "open"
kind = "task"
labels = []
blocked_by = []
created_at = "<created_at>"
updated_at = "<updated_at>"
```
exit 0
````

### E-PIN-04 — an id argument in no recognized form

Setup: bare-remote, bootstrapped, `storage = "state-ref"` tracked

```console
$ aco item show not-an-id
2> ERROR: 'not-an-id' is not an item reference; use aco-xxxxxx, #n, or the bare number n
exit 2
```

### E-PIN-07 — a hand-corrupted item file

Setup: bare-remote, bootstrapped, `storage = "state-ref"` tracked, `items/aco-000001.md` hand-written with no `agent-claim` block

```console
$ aco item show aco-000001
2> ERROR: item aco-000001 has a malformed agent-claim block; repair it with aco item edit aco-000001 and a body whose agent-claim block carries a valid [record]
exit 2
$ aco next
2> ERROR: item aco-000001 has a malformed agent-claim block; repair it with aco item edit aco-000001 and a body whose agent-claim block carries a valid [record]
exit 2
```

### E-PIN-08 — editing an item

Setup: bare-remote, bootstrapped, `storage = "state-ref"` tracked, `<item-id>` already open

````console
$ aco item edit <item-id> <<'BODY'
```agent-claim
version = 1
now = "Cut on 19.09.2026."
next = "Build it."
done_when = "It is built."
```
BODY
EDITED <item-id>
exit 0
````

### E-PIN-09 — closing an item that freed another

Setup: bare-remote, bootstrapped, `storage = "state-ref"` tracked, `<item-id>` open with no live claim, `<other-id>` open and blocked only by `<item-id>`

```console
$ aco item close <item-id>
CLOSED <item-id>
freed: <other-id>
exit 0
$ aco item close <item-id>
2> ERROR: <item-id> is already closed (closed on <closed_at>)
exit 2
```

### E-PIN-10 — closing an item no entry carries, forge-less remote

Setup: bare-remote, bootstrapped, `storage = "state-ref"` tracked, no `items/aco-ffffff.md`

```console
$ aco item close aco-ffffff
2> ERROR: aco-ffffff does not exist in <remote>
exit 2
```
